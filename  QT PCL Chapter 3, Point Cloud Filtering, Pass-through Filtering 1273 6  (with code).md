#  II. Core Code 

The implementation process of pass filtering in PCL is as follows: 

 ```python

 ```  
#  Third, qt settings 

1. UI layout, the new control here is shown in the figure below, radioButton. The main function is as a selection function.

  2, filter_pt h and filter_pt cpp settings 

The settings are as follows, and radioButton should be set to select uniqueness, as follows: 

 ```python

 ```  
3. Set in the pcl_function, add the header file and function declaration required for filtering in .h, and add the core code in the .cpp file. As described in the previous chapter. 4. The settings of mainwindow.h and mainwindow.cpp are the same as those set in the previous sections. I will not introduce too much here. 

Qmake, just build it, and at this point, the point cloud pass-through filter module has been integrated into the software.
